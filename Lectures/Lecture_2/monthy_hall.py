# Simulates the Monty Hall problem.
# - A car is hidden behind 3 doors.
# - The contestant randomly choses a door.
# - The game host opens a door behind which there is no car.
# - The contestant then has the option to change her mind and open another door.
# Prompts the user for the number of times the game is played,
# and whether the contestant opts for switching door or not.
# Displays the details of the game for the few first games,
# set to a maximum of 6 by default,
# and prints out the proportion of games being won.
