The rumour ricocheted through Parliament House as if in a pinball machine. Malcolm Turnbull to appoint Joe Hockey to replace him as Communications Minister. Insiders host Barrie Cassidy set the chatter running in a detailed early morning prognostication on Wednesday. Of all his predictions, Arthur Sinodinos to employment, Michaelia Cash to immigration, this was the most intriguing.

Turnbull confidants were quick to hose down the speculation. But he is also one of the most experienced journalists around, so people took notice. 


Turnbull will effectively be the Prime Minister for Communications, leaving little room for his replacement to establish their own authority. Few ministers have been as wellprepared for a portfolio as Turnbull was for communications, a motley collection of mobile and broadband policy, public broadcasting, media regulation and postal services. He also cofounded internet provider Ozemail and is a famous early adopter of technology, be it the iPad or secret messaging app Wickr. Turnbull was a highly active minister, leaving few big issues to be resolved. He also changed the regulations for Australia Post, allowing it to introduce a twospeed letter service. He introduced a new warnings scheme to crack down on copyright infringement and oversaw the new data retention laws. On Wednesday Turnbull said he was looking forward to discussing media ownership with his cabinet.
